# Blaaycubs_Shipping

This is a program that takes the weight of a package and determines the cheapest way to ship that package using Blaaycub's Shippers.

Blaaycubs’s Shippers has several different options for a customer to ship their package:

Ground Shipping, which is a small flat charge plus a rate based on the weight of your package.
Ground Shipping Premium, which is a much higher flat charge, but you aren’t charged for weight.
Drone Shipping (new), which has no flat charge, but the rate based on weight is triple the rate of ground shipping.

Here are the prices:
